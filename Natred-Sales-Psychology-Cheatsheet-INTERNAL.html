        <h1>Sales Psychology Playbook</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">How to read the room, build trust fast, steer conversations, and close &mdash; without being a pushy prick about it.</div>

        <div class="intro">
            <strong>This isn't about tricking anyone.</strong> It's about understanding how people make decisions and positioning Natred as the obvious choice. The best salespeople don't "sell" &mdash; they ask the right questions, listen properly, and make the client feel like switching to us was their idea. <strong>Every technique here is about building genuine trust while guiding the conversation towards a close.</strong>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 1: First Impressions -->
        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-header">
                <div class="section-number">01</div>
                <h2>First 90 Seconds &mdash; Setting the Frame</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Mirror Their Energy</h4>
                <p>Match their pace, volume, and formality within the first 30 seconds. If they're relaxed and chatty, loosen up. If they're clipped and time-pressed, get straight to it. <strong>People trust people who feel like them.</strong> Don't walk in with big sales energy if they're a quiet, analytical type.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Name Drop Early, Naturally</h4>
                <p>Use their name once in the first minute &mdash; not more. "Good to meet you, James" not "So James, James let me tell you James..." People register their own name subconsciously. <strong>Once is rapport. Twice is try-hard. Three times is creepy.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Give Them Status</h4>
                <p>Open with something that positions them as the expert in their business. "You obviously know your operation better than anyone &mdash; I just want to understand where IT fits into that." <strong>This disarms the defensive wall</strong> because you're not coming in acting like you know better.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <div class="tip-label">The Golden Rule</div>
                <p>Whoever asks the questions controls the conversation. Your job in the first 5 minutes is to ask, not pitch. The more they talk, the more they trust you, and the more ammunition you have to position Natred as the solution.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

                <div class="section-number">02</div>
                <h2>Discovery &mdash; Finding the Pain</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The "Tell Me About" Opener</h4>
                <p>Never start with "What's your IT setup?" &mdash; that's a quiz and they'll get defensive if they don't know the answer. Instead: <strong>"Tell me about a typical day when something goes wrong with IT."</strong> This gets them telling stories, and stories reveal the real pain.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The 3-Why Drill</h4>
                <p>When they mention a problem, ask "why" three times (gently). "Our email goes down sometimes." &rarr; Why does that happen? &rarr; "Our IT guy says it's the server." &rarr; Why hasn't that been sorted? &rarr; "Honestly, I don't think he knows how." <strong>Now you've got the real problem: incompetent IT support.</strong> That's what you sell against.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Quantify the Pain</h4>
                <p>Make them do the maths. "How often does that happen? And when it does, how long is the team down for? So roughly 4 hours a month of lost productivity across 20 people &mdash; that's 80 person-hours." <strong>When they hear their own numbers, the cost of doing nothing becomes real.</strong></p>

                <h2>Building Trust &mdash; The Honesty Advantage</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Admit What You Don't Do</h4>
                <p>This is Natred's superpower. When a prospect mentions something outside our wheelhouse (CCTV, access control, telecoms), say: <strong>"That's not us &mdash; but we work with a specialist who handles that. We'd rather you get the right person than have us wing it."</strong> This does two things: builds massive trust, and positions everything you DO offer as credible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The Anti-Pitch</h4>
                <p>Early in the conversation, say something like: "Look, I'm not here to sell you anything today. I genuinely just want to understand what's going on and see if we can help. If we can't, I'll tell you." <strong>This lowers their guard completely</strong> because every other IT company walks in selling. You're the one who didn't.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Strategic Vulnerability</h4>
                <p>Share a brief, honest moment. "We had a client last year where we underestimated the migration timeline. We owned it, extended the support at no cost, and they're still with us." <strong>Admitting a past mistake (with a good resolution) makes everything else you say more believable.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The Transparency Play</h4>
                <p>When pricing comes up: "We'll show you exactly what everything costs &mdash; our cost, our margin, the lot. You'll never look at an invoice from us and wonder what you're paying for." <strong>This is a dagger to their current IT company</strong> because most of them bury their margins. You don't even have to say that &mdash; the client will think it themselves.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h2>Framing &mdash; Controlling the Narrative</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Anchor High, Land Right</h4>
                <p>If they ask about cost, don't start with your price. Start with the cost of NOT doing it. "Most businesses we talk to are losing R30&ndash;50k a month in downtime and inefficiency. Our managed service for a team your size is a fraction of that." <strong>Now your price isn't an expense &mdash; it's a saving.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Reframe Every Problem as an IT Problem</h4>
                <p>"Our staff waste time searching for documents" = SharePoint implementation. "We can't get reports fast enough" = BI dashboard. "Our reception is overwhelmed" = AI assistant. <strong>Train yourself to hear business problems and mentally map them to our services.</strong> Then feed it back: "That sounds like a [service] problem &mdash; we solve that."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The "Other Clients Like You" Frame</h4>
                <p>People follow people like them. "We work with a few [medical practices / law firms / logistics companies] and they all had the same issue." <strong>This does three things:</strong> social proof, shows you understand their industry, and normalises the problem so they don't feel embarrassed about it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Future Pacing</h4>
                <p>Paint the after picture. "Imagine your team on a Monday morning &mdash; everything just works. No tickets, no 'my email's down,' no waiting for the IT guy. That's what we deliver." <strong>Get them to visualise the outcome, not the process.</strong> People buy feelings, not features.</p>

                <p>Don't ask "Would you like to go ahead?" Ask: <strong>"So the next step would be for us to do a quick assessment of your setup &mdash; takes about an hour, no cost. When works best for you?"</strong> You're not asking IF, you're asking WHEN. This skips the yes/no decision entirely.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The Summary Close</h4>
                <p>Before you ask for the next step, summarise their pain back to them using their own words. "So you've got email issues every other week, nobody's tested the backups, and you're not sure what you're paying your current IT company for. Does that sound right?" <strong>When they say yes, they've just talked themselves into needing you.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Reduce the Risk</h4>
                <p>"Start with one thing. Let us sort out your [biggest pain point] and see how we operate. No long-term contract, no commitment beyond that. If we're good, we'll talk about the rest." <strong>Small commitments lead to big ones.</strong> Once they're in, they rarely leave.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The Silence Close</h4>
                <p>After you've made your recommendation and asked for the next step &mdash; <strong>shut up.</strong> Don't fill the silence. Don't add "but no pressure" or "think about it." Just wait. The first person to speak loses. Silence creates psychological pressure to respond, and most people respond with yes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <div class="tip-label">Critical Rule</div>
                <p>Never ask a question you don't know the answer to. By the time you're closing, you should already know they need you. The close is a formality, not a gamble. If you're not sure they're ready, you haven't done enough discovery.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Lean In When They Talk About Pain</h4>
                <p>When they describe a frustration, lean slightly forward and nod slowly. This signals "I take this seriously." <strong>When you lean back, it signals "this is easy to fix"</strong> &mdash; use that when you're presenting the solution. The contrast between the two positions subconsciously tells them: your problem is serious, but we've got it handled.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Take Notes Visibly</h4>
                <p>Write things down when they speak, even if you'll remember it. <strong>Visible note-taking says "what you're telling me matters."</strong> It also gives you a reason to pause and say "hang on, let me get that down" which slows the conversation and makes it feel consultative, not salesy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>Match Their Breathing</h4>
                <p>Sounds weird. Works. If you subtly match someone's breathing pace, your speech rhythms naturally sync. <strong>Synchronised rhythm builds unconscious rapport.</strong> You don't need to stare at their chest &mdash; just notice if they're breathing fast (stressed) or slow (relaxed) and adjust your pace.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>The Pause Before the Answer</h4>
                <p>When they ask you something, pause for 2 seconds before responding &mdash; even if you know the answer instantly. <strong>This makes you look thoughtful rather than rehearsed.</strong> A rapid-fire answer feels scripted. A considered answer feels honest.</p>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>"We're Happy With Our Current IT"</h4>
                <p>"That's great &mdash; I'd be worried if you weren't. Out of curiosity though, if you could change one thing about how your IT is handled, what would it be?" <strong>There's always one thing.</strong> That one thing is your way in. Nobody has perfect IT. Once they admit the gap, you own that gap.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>"We Don't Have Budget for This"</h4>
                <p>"Totally understand. Let me ask though &mdash; what's the cost of leaving things as they are? If your team is losing [X hours] a month to [their pain], that's already costing you. We're not adding a cost, we're replacing a bigger one." <strong>Reframe from expense to investment.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>"Send Me a Proposal and I'll Think About It"</h4>
                <p>This is a soft no. Don't just send the proposal. "Of course &mdash; I want to make sure it's spot on though. Can we grab 15 minutes next week so I can walk you through it? It'll make a lot more sense in context." <strong>You just booked another meeting instead of getting ghosted.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="technique">
                <h4>"I Need to Discuss With My Partner / Board"</h4>
                <p>"Absolutely. What do you think their main concern will be?" Whatever they say, address it now. "Would it help if I put together a one-pager that covers [their concern]? Makes your job easier when you present it." <strong>You've just armed your champion with your sales material.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <div class="tip-label">Remember</div>
                <p>Every objection is a buying signal in disguise. If they weren't interested, they'd just say "no thanks" and end the call. The fact that they're giving you reasons means they're trying to talk themselves into it &mdash; they just need you to make it easy.</p>
